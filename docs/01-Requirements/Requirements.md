## Module Requirements
The following sections describe the functional and component requirements for the actuation module of Team 307’s submersible exploration device. The module must enable reliable underwater propulsion using a motor driven propeller for forward and backwards motion, and incorporate a secondary motor to provide directional steering. The module also includes strech goals of a waterproofed system. 

| **Requirement Description** | **Measure of<br> Threshold** | **Target<br>Measure** |**Stretch<br>Requirement<br>(Y-N)**|
|-----------------------------| ----------------- | ----------------- | :-----: |
| Surface mounted, 3.3V switching power regulatore | 3.2 Volts | 3.3 Volts | No |
| Surface mounted microcontroller | 1 PIC or ESP | 8-bit PIC | No |
| Wireless Communication | Able to send or receive a Wi-Fi data | Send and receive Wi-Fi Data to MQTT whether or not the system is moving | No |
| 12V Gear motor  | Able to effectively move whole system | Move quickly and efficiently | No |
|Motor mounted propeller  | Able to spin on the motor shaft  | A slipless spin for efficient forward or backward movement | No |
